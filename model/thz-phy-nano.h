 *
 * This class represents the physical layer for nanoscale THz
 * communication based on TSOOK, a modulation scheme based on the
 * transmission of hundred-femtosecond long pulses spread in time.
 * In addition, it allows the node to interleave multiple transmissions
 * and receptions. In case of collision between two receptions, it
 * calculates the SINR and accepts the packet if SINR is greater than the threshold.
