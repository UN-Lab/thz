 *
 * When a packet is enqueued in the THzMacNano, it checks if it has
 * enough energy. If it does have sufficient energy to complete a
 * transmission, it passes the frame over to PHY layer for 0-way
 * or sends an RTS packet for 2-way handshake protocol. Otherwise, it just
 * puts the packet in the queue and waits for energy model to call back.
